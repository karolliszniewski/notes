Let me help you troubleshoot these Magento 2 issues. These problems often occur due to database inconsistencies or indexing issues. Here's a systematic approach to diagnose and fix the problems:

First, check for inconsistencies in the database:

bashCopy# Connect to your database and run these queries to check for orphaned product data
SELECT * FROM catalog_product_entity WHERE entity_id NOT IN (SELECT product_id FROM catalog_product_website);
SELECT * FROM catalog_product_entity WHERE entity_id NOT IN (SELECT entity_id FROM catalog_product_entity_varchar);

Try reindexing all indices:

bashCopyphp bin/magento indexer:reset
php bin/magento indexer:reindex

Clear cache:

bashCopyphp bin/magento cache:clean
php bin/magento cache:flush

For the missing export data issue, check these areas:

a) Verify the product attribute visibility settings in:

Stores > Attributes > Product
Make sure necessary attributes have "Used in Product Listing" set to "Yes"

b) Check if products are assigned to websites:
sqlCopySELECT cpe.entity_id, cpe.sku 
FROM catalog_product_entity cpe 
LEFT JOIN catalog_product_website cpw ON cpe.entity_id = cpw.product_id 
WHERE cpw.product_id IS NULL;

If problems persist, try cleaning up the following:

bashCopy# Remove var/generation, var/cache, and var/page_cache
rm -rf var/generation/* var/cache/* var/page_cache/*

# Deploy static content
php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy -f

# Compile DI
php bin/magento setup:di:compile
If these steps don't resolve the issue, check the Magento logs:

var/log/system.log
var/log/exception.log
var/log/debug.log

Additional Troubleshooting:

Check if the product is properly associated with a store view:

sqlCopySELECT * FROM catalog_product_entity_int 
WHERE attribute_id = (SELECT attribute_id FROM eav_attribute 
WHERE attribute_code = 'status' AND entity_type_id = 4)
AND entity_id = [YOUR_PRODUCT_ID];

Verify product stock status:

sqlCopySELECT * FROM cataloginventory_stock_item 
WHERE product_id = [YOUR_PRODUCT_ID];

Check for corrupt media gallery entries:

sqlCopySELECT * FROM catalog_product_entity_media_gallery_value_to_entity 
WHERE entity_id = [YOUR_PRODUCT_ID];
If none of these solutions work, you might need to:

Take a database backup
Delete the problematic product completely
Recreate the product from scratch

For the export issues, also verify:

PHP memory_limit is set high enough
MySQL max_allowed_packet is sufficient
Check if all product attributes are properly set up in the attribute sets

Let me know if you need clarification on any of these steps or if you'd like to try a specific solution first.
